                                            Kubernetes Artifacts in Action

Problem Statement: 

                        Most of the companies rely on the Kubernetes Artifacts for the production deployment. We can perform all the operation on kubernetes cluster using the artifacts. Artifacts are nothing but simple YAML POJO where we fill in the details and apply on kubernetes cluster. 
                        In the lecture we saw the use of ConfigMap, deployment and service yaml files with example. 

You have to implement simple Web Application in any language you prefer and deploy that code on Kubernetes cluster using Artifacts.
