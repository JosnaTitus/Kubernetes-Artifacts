                                            Kubernetes Artifacts in Action

Problem Statement: 

      We can perform all the operation on kubernetes cluster using the artifacts. Artifacts are nothing but simple YAML POJO where we fill in the details and apply on kubernetes cluster. 
      You have to implement simple Web Application in any language you prefer and deploy that code on Kubernetes cluster using Artifacts.
